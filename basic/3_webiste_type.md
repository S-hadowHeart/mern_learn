# Static vs Dynamic Websites – Overview Notes

## Static Website

### What is a Static Website?
A static website consists of fixed files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) served exactly as they are stored.  
The content does not change unless a developer manually updates the files.

---

### Advantages of Static Websites
- Very fast loading time
- Simple to develop and deploy
- Lower hosting cost
- More secure (no database or server-side code)
- Easy to host on CDN or static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)

---

### Disadvantages of Static Websites
- Content updates require code changes
- Not suitable for large or frequently changing data
- Limited interactivity (without heavy client-side JavaScript)
- No built-in backend or database support

---

### When to Use a Static Website
- Personal portfolios
- Company landing pages
- Documentation websites
- Blogs with infrequent updates
- Marketing pages
- Small business websites with fixed content

---

## Dynamic Website

### What is a Dynamic Website?
A dynamic website generates content at runtime using server-side logic and databases.  
The content can change based on user input, time, or stored data.

---

### Advantages of Dynamic Websites
- Content can be updated without changing frontend code
- Supports user authentication and authorization
- Can handle complex business logic
- Database-driven (users, posts, products, etc.)
- Highly interactive and customizable

---

### Disadvantages of Dynamic Websites
- Slower than static sites (depends on server performance)
- More complex to develop and maintain
- Higher hosting and infrastructure cost
- Increased security risks (servers, databases, APIs)

---

### When to Prefer a Dynamic Website
- E-commerce platforms
- Social media websites
- Web applications (dashboards, admin panels)
- Content management systems (CMS)
- Websites with user login and personalized data
- Applications requiring real-time updates

---

## Summary
- Static websites focus on speed, simplicity, and security
- Dynamic websites focus on flexibility, interaction, and data-driven content
- Choose static when content is mostly fixed
- Choose dynamic when content changes frequently or depends on users
