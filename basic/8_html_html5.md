# Introduction to HTML and HTML5

## Introduction to HTML
**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and web applications.  
It is the foundation of the World Wide Web and is used to describe the structure of content in documents.

HTML is used to define elements such as:
- Headings
- Paragraphs
- Lists
- Links
- Quotes
- Images and media

HTML focuses on **structure**, not appearance or behavior.

It introduces new features and elements that allow developers to create more interactive, multimedia-rich, and semantic web content.

HTML5 improves:
- Multimedia handling
- Page structure
- User experience
- Accessibility and SEO
- Application-level features

## Advantages of HTML
- Easy and simple to learn and use
- Widely supported by almost all web browsers
- Standard language for structuring web pages
- Lightweight code, resulting in faster page loading
- Free to use and does not require any external software
- Runs directly in web browsers

## Disadvantages of HTML
- Can only create static web pages without dynamic functionality
- Requires multiple lines of code even for simple components
- No built-in syntax error detection
- Errors are often detected only after viewing output
- Very limited built-in security features
- Can be difficult to manage and understand in large projects
